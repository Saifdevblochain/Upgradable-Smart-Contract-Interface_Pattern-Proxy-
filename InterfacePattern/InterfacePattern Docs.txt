Interface Upgradable Pattern:
User always interact with the main contract which contains business logic.
However, Main function relies on the interface to communicate with the implementation contract.

 The main contract contains an upgradeTo method which allows the owner of the main contract to change the implementation address.

We can only update logic in the function in this.
